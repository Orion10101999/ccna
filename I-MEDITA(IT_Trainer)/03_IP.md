## Concept of Public IP and Private IP

### Public :

* Public IP addresses are those addresses which are easily accessible via internet . They are unique in the world .

* Everyone who wants to communicate using internet should have a globally unique IP .

### Private :

* Private IP addresses are those addresses which can be used by private organization internally .

* These are not routable on Internet .

* Not everyone needs a globally unique IP if they are not going to access the internet . 

### Private IP Ranges :-

* Class - A        10.0.0.0     -       10.255.255.255
* Class - B      172.16.0.0     -       172.31.255.255
* Class - C    192.1680.0.0     -       192.168.255.255

OR in other way we can write them as


* Class - A   10.0.0.0       255.0.0.0  (10.0.0.0/8)
* Class - B   172.16.0.0     255.240.0.0 (172.16.0.0)
* Class - C   192.1680.0.0   255.255.0.0 (192.168.0.0/16)

* We use private ranges in our LAN and translate those addresses with the help of NAT - Network Address Translation . ( More on this later )

## 133. IP Address :

* IP address are categorised in 3 styles 

### Unicast 

* these addressess are used for One-to-One

### Multicast 

* these addressess are used for One-to-Many communication ranging from 244.0.0.0    239.255.255.255

### Broadcast 

* these addressess are used for One-to-All and is useful when the destination is unknown .

* Layer - 3 Broadcast = IP Address = 255.255.255.255
