## Q.1. What is  networking ?

- computer network , two or more computers that are connected with one another for purpose of communicating data electronically .

## Types of Computer network :-

- Two basic network types are local areas networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs)

## Ways of Communication :-

- Simplex : One way communication .

- Half Duplex : Two way communication but at a time one way .

- Full Duplex : Real time two way communication .

## Types of Communications :-

* INTRANET :

- private online network only accessible to within an organization .


* Extranet :

- Interanet that is partially accesible to people outside the organization .



* Internet :

- Global online network that provides information and communication tools .




## Network Interface Card (NIC) :-


* NIC is the interface between the computer and the network .

* It is also known as the Lan card or Ethernet card 

* Ethernet cards have a unique 48 bit address called as MAC (Media access control) address .

    - MAC address is also called as Physical address or hardware address .

    - The 48 bit MAC address is represented as 12 Hexa-decimal digits .

    - Example : 0016.D3FC.603F

* Network cards are available in different speeds 

    - Ethernet (10 Mbps)
    - Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)
    - Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps)

## Straight Through Cable :-

* Generally used for connecting two devices of different types 

* EIA / TIA 568B

* Electronic Industries Alliance / Telecommunications Indestry Association

## Crossover Cable :

* Generally used for connecting same type of devices .

* EIA / TIA 568B


## Comparision between OSI & TCP / IP Model  :-

- OSI Model Layers                  TCP/IP Layers
